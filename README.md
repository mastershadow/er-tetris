# ER-TETRIS

A tetris clone made by me ([Eduard Roccatello](http://www.roccatello.it])) from scratch.
The purpose of this is to pratice with game development foundation because, while I'm already experienced with 2D/3D frameworks, I am willing to go deeper and create everything by myself.

This is the first step in a long path.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
